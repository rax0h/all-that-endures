Local earlier checkout bf5261b is behind the live baseline. Inspected delta: 19 files / 1044 additions / 23 deletions; preserves four household gates and checked owner-scoped index, living consumers and tail deletion. Source begins from the complete planning commit. Earlier uncommitted identity proposal/regression remain untouched in ownership-repair, outside this implementation tree; they are superseded by the approved counted-tree/catalog design, not silently integrated.

Capability 6 is unallocated at baseline (supported floors 3/4/5). Do not advertise 6 until all mandatory new authorities are complete.

## Preflight shared interfaces

| Producer → consumer | Contract and ruling |
|---|---|
| 1 → 2,4,5,6 | Static concrete adapters classify all root collections, including eager owners. Immutable participant deltas encode inputs before commit. Existing central commit remains the only publisher. |
| 2 → 3,4,5 | One registry; catalog proves complete pinned groups and exact owner membership. Coordinator overlays replacement/deletion before routing. History references preserve incarnations. |
| 3 → 4 | Stable occurrence IDs separate from rank and physical slot. Counted tree supersedes older sparse-vacancy proposal; duplicates/order remain exact. |
| 4,5 → 6 | Compact children expose shared cache accounting and retirement leases. Header/projection revisions govern pressure invalidation; native sum preserved. |
| 1–6 → 7 | Final full suite is deferred until stable integrated source. One final fresh architectural review; ordinary failures repaired inline. |

## Package 1: contracts and baseline inventory

RED: four new contract tests failed because the family/participant module did not exist. Fixture corrections during GREEN: use module-qualified names for the two Institution classes; supply required expected_record_schema to read_version. These were test-fixture mistakes, not production defects.
GREEN: PYTHONPATH=.:simulation /workspace/scratch/c3a830e86cea/ownership-gate-venv/bin/python -m pytest -q --tb=short simulation/tests/test_stage_0_5_final_contracts.py simulation/tests/test_persistence_lazy_identity_reverse.py simulation/tests/test_persistence_lazy_store.py simulation/tests/test_persistence_lazy_store_failures.py — 68 passed in 5.51s.

Added static family declarations and exhaustive field classification (future fields fail coverage), immutable byte-backed ParticipantDelta / SaveParticipant interface, and actual store-I/O measurement deltas. SQL rows examined are explicitly unknown; query plans/scale measurements remain separate evidence. No storage format change or claim of participant integration yet. Inventory lists pending compact representations and unrestricted import costs honestly; exact writer/bound evidence is refined with each integration package.

Next: permanent missing reverse-occurrence regression and checked catalog, then affected-group coordinator. Packages 2–7 remain incomplete. No final suite, final review or endurance launched.

## Release decision still open

Implement exact bounded-memory ordered native pressure sum and measure O(H) cache misses. Owner has not authorized that latency exception or changed arithmetic. This does not block continued implementation; it blocks production acceptance. Endurance/restore retention and promotion remain separately authorized gates.
